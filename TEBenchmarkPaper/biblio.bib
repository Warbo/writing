                  cognitive science, and philosophy. In spite of its
                  importance in the "information age," there is no
                  consensus on what information is, what makes it
                  possible, and what it means for one medium to carry
                  information about another. Drawing on ideas from
                  mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, this
                  book addresses the definition and place of
                  information in society. The authors, observing that
                  information flow is possible only within a connected
                  distribution system, provide a mathematically
                  rigorous, philosophically sound foundation for a
                  science of information. They illustrate their theory
                  by applying it to a wide range of phenomena, from
                  file transfer to DNA, from quantum mechanics to
                  speech act theory.}},

method. ProB's automated animation facilities allow users to gain confidence in their specifications.
ProB also contains a model checker and a refinement checker, both of which can  be used to detect various errors in B specifications. We describe the underlying methodology of ProB, and present the important aspects of the implementation.
We also present empirical evaluations as well as several
 case studies, highlighting that ProB enables users to uncover errors that are not easily discovered by existing tools.},
