These theorems are used as the ground truth for precision/recall experiments on
theories of the Natural numers and lists. They're taken from the following
sources:

 - Conjecture Synthesis for Inductive Theories by Johansson, Dixon and Bundy,
   section 10.2 Precision/Recall Analysis.

 - Scheme-based theorem discovery and concept invention, Monato-Rivas,
   McCasland, Dixon and Bundy, section 7.1.1 Naturals with Addition,
   Multiplication and Exponentiation, and table D.1
