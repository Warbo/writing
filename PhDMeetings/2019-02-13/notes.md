Main theme of thesis: how does Theory Exploration fit into the landscape of AI,
software development, etc.?

Would have been nice to improve the state of the art with bucketing, but it
didn't work :( Contribution shifts to bigger-picture argument; bucketing becomes
a "case study".

Send bucketing stuff to Alison to see what we can get for a CICM-style paper?

Note that katya is coauthor on this, so we'll need to send her a copy when
drafted. She could be going to CICM already, if we need a presenter.

Try reframing existing bucketing paper, maybe using bounds to show the potential
of "solving" this problem (even though we didn't solve it ourselves). Look for
patterns in the optimal buckets, etc. to see if we can spot why similarity
doesn't work. See how much we can get away with before things break down; e.g.
we might not be able to optimally bucket into the smallest sizes, but can we,
say, split things roughly in half?

Alison is involved in 3 papers on computational creativity, with Simon Colton
and 2 others from Heriot Watt. Their deadline is the 2019-02-28.

The 3 papers are on:

 - Coincidences,
 - Framing (with Mike Cook, who works on procedural generation in games)
 - Case study in the domain of geology. This might have input from me?

Might get some Overleaf links sent over this week.

We should look through some bucketing data, see if there are patterns to explain
it.
