# Theory Exploration #

Theory Exploration describes any system for turning a "theory" (signature
and variables) into terms of that theory which are *well-formed*, *provable* and
*interesting*.

. . .

## Comparison Criteria ##

 - **How do we generate terms?**
 - **How do we guarantee well-formedness?**
 - **How do we prove terms?**
 - **What is considered "interesting"?**

# (Interactive) Theory Exploration

> Mathematical theory exploration proceeds by applying, under the guidance of a
> human user, various algorithmic reasoners for producing new formulae from
> given ones and aims at building up (large) mathematical knowledge bases in an
> efficient, reliable, well-structured, re-usable, and flexible way.
> -- (Buchberger 2004)

Example: Theorema

 - **How do we generate terms?** User-driven
 - **How do we guarantee well-formedness?** Types and pre-conditions
 - **How do we prove terms?** Automated Theorem Provers
 - **What is considered "interesting"?** User-driven

Examples: IsaCoSy, Hipster, **HipSpec**

 - **How do we generate terms?** Propose equations between enumerated expressions
 - **How do we guarantee well-formedness?** Types
 - **How do we prove terms?** Automated Theorem Provers
 - **What is considered "interesting"?** Un-derivable from previous equations

# Why Automated Theory Exploration? #

Strengths:

 - Exposing problematic assumptions
 - Finding simple relationships
 - Autonomous
 - Open-ended, anytime

Weaknesses:

 - Scales poorly with theory & formula size
 - Can't propose new notions/definitions

**Problem:** Doesn't seem to align very well with general Mathematics

# Why Automated Theory Exploration? #

Strengths:

 - Exposing problematic assumptions
 - Finding simple relationships
 - Autonomous
 - Open-ended, anytime

Weaknesses:

 - Scales poorly with theory & formula size
 - Can't propose novel notions/axioms

**Solution:** Aligns well with *programming*

# Haskell #

 - **Equational**: definitions, rewrite rules & coercions
 - **Pure:** Effects are separate from computation
 - **Strong types**: Algebraic datatypes, parametricity
 - **Popular:** Relatively large code repositories (eg. Hackage)
 - **Already studied:** HipSpec works with Haskell expressions

Haskell code often follows algebraic laws which Haskell is unable to express!

# Identifying Improvements #

HipSpec is state-of-the-art. How might it be scaled up?

 - **Well-formedness:** Types work well enough
 - **Proof:** ATP works well enough

# Improving Term Generation #

 - In theory: enumeration scales exponentially
 - In reality: types constrain the combinations
    - Requires investigation!
 - Search problem:
    - Well-studied in Artificial Intelligence
    - Heuristics, optimisation
    - Machine Learning

# Improving "Interestingness"

 - Un-derivability is elegant, but misses some intuitions
    - "Non-obvious" reductions
    - Irrelevant/incidental relationships
 - Well-studied in Machine Learning and Data Mining
    - e.g. mutual information, "surprise"
 - What kinds of properties do we tend to care about?
    - Look at what we tend to test!

 - Framework for ATE experiments in Haskell
 - Based around QuickCheck (HipSpec's exploration component)
 - Theories are Haskell packages
 - Divide and conquer

# Generating Theories #

 - Use Cabal to get/build package
 - Use GHC plugin to extract top-level names and ASTs
 - Try to put each name in a theory
 - Discard errors:
    - Non-exported names
    - Artifacts of Core (eg. typeclass dictionaries)
    - Type errors
 - Generate Haskell project with the successes
 - Use Nix to handle dependencies

# Divide and Conquer #

 - Inspired by premise selection in ATP clustering in ML4PG
 - No need to compare everything to everything else
    - Select sub-sets which appear related
 - Initial approach: cluster by similarity
 - Future approaches:
    - Pair-wise premise selection?
    - Off-the-shelf ML algorithms (eg. ANN)?

# Clustering #

 - Extract definitions (Core), via GHC plugin
 - Topological sort by dependencies
 - Feature extraction by recurrent clustering:
    - Turn AST into a matrix
    - Replace symbols by their cluster number
    - Repeat

# Recurrent Clustering Example #

`inc x = x + 1`

```{pipe="cat > cluster.dit"}
          +-----+-----+     +----+---+
     /--->| "+" |     |     |  1 | 0 |
     |    +-----+-----+ --> +----+---+
     |    | "x" | "1" |     | -1 | 2 |
     |    +-----+-----+     +----+---+
     |             ^
     |             |

|Cluster 1  | |Cluster 2       |
|           | |                |
|+ pow ++ ..| | 1 [] Nothing ..|

```{.unwrap pipe="sh | pandoc -f html -t json"}
ditaa -E cluster.dit cluster.png > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
DATA=$(base64 -w 0 < cluster.png)

```

# Applications #

 - Finding redundancy/duplication across libraries
 - Refactoring aid
 - Finding isomorphisms
 - Finding rewrite rules
 - Finding new typeclasses (sets of "laws")

Thank you to the HipSpec team at Chalmers University (Moa Johansson,
Koen Claessen, Nick Smallbone, Dan Ros√©n and Irene Lobo Valbuena) for useful
discussions of these ideas, and Ouanis Seddaoui for help with our implementation.
