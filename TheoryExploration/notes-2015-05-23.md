## Feature Extraction ##

The first feature extraction system to be tested was a pre-existing script based on *circular convolution*. In principle this should, with high probability, send different s-expressions to orthogonal bit vectors; ie. it approximates exact matching. In practice, the single-bit features in the leaves tended to get lost during convolution in the nodes:

```{pipe="sh > /dev/stderr"}
echo "HS2ASTSRC: '$HS2ASTSRC'"
ml4hs "$HS2ASTSRC"
```

\iffalse

\fi

Running ML4HS

e877f0d with TreeFeatures 6eb6924 and HS2AST 512572b,
on the HS2AST 512572b directory, gives all zeros :(

```{pipe="sh"}

```

Running ML4HS e877f0d with TreeFeatures ae8053b and HS2AST 512572b,
again on the HS2AST 512572b directory, gives a mixture of numbers:
