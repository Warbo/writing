Subject: Run QuickSpec on strictly-accumulating mult2, op and qexp
Message-Id: <f1fe36ed8b70a723-0-artemis@nixos>

The functions mult2, op and qexp are tail-recursive, so should be pretty
efficient (although qexp would presumably make huge Integers).

We should write two versions of each: one with a strict accumulator and
another without, and QuickSpec each individually (timing them).
