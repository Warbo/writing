Subject: TEBenchmark: Look for examples of rejected logically valid outputs
Message-Id: <b8693a93800db3ad-0-artemis@nixos>

A common complaint about the paper is that we're checking syntactic
equality, whereas more logically-powerful alternatives could be used.

We have the output data as JSON, so we should look to see whether this
is actually a problem in reality.
