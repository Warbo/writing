# Post-May plan #

## Current status ##

The following components are all quite extensive, but can still be extended
indefinitely:

 - Background
 - Literature review
 - Related work
 - Future work

Because of this, I think they should be mostly left alone until the core parts
are finished. The current text is a little muddled/duplicated in areas, but can
be sent across for review.

The core components of the thesis are the following:

 - Benchmarking: This is done (content mostly the same as paper)

 - Signature selection (AKA "bucketing"): This needs work, to format the graphs,
   present and explain what was done, etc. Say 2 weeks to make "readable", ready
   to iterate on.

 - Recurrent clustering: all parts are written, but need disentangling from the
   signature selection text. Say 2 weeks to make "readable", ready to iterate
   on.

Introduction, conclusion, etc. have scattered pieces from various documents.
Advice tends to say do these last; will take around 1 week each to be "readable"
and ready to iterate on.

## Plan ##

Immediate:

 - Send benchmark for review (no changes since last sent)
 - Send literature review for review (no changes since last sent)
 - Send background for review
 - Send future work for review

By end of May:

 - Send signature selection for review
 - Iterate on reviewed work as needed

By mid-June:

 - Send related work for review
 - Send recurrent clustering for review
 - Iterate on reviewed work as needed
 - Start planning viva logistics

By end of June:

 - Send introduction for review
 - Send discussion/conclusion for review
 - Iterate on reviewed work as needed

July:

 - Iterative revisions
 - Extend background/related work/etc. if needed

Is it realistic to have a finished draft by end of July? Can send to external
examiner.
