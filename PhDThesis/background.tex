\chapter{Background}

\iffalse TODO: Alison: Each chapter should have a description at the start (see
bucketing ``in this chapter'') \fi

% Background should cover approaches to automated reasoning about software, and
% formal systems in general. We can highlight how the language/representation
% imposes invariants and guarantees on what we can know, and how we can extend
% those guarantees with features like purity (prevents behaviour depending on
% ambient environment/state), lazy evaluation (prevents problems with
% non-termination), sound type systems (limits the space of possible values for
% each expression), etc. and therefore how Haskell is a natural vehicle for us to
% use. Giving background on Haskell naturally leads to descendants like Agda and
% Idris, which are also interactive theorem provers; which lets us discuss
% Isabelle, Coq, HOL, etc., how they're difficult for existing reasoning
% algorithms to handle (e.g. resolution, which works well in first-order logics),
% approaches to helping
