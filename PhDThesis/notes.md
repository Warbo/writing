Lit review puts things in context; makes sense without knowing what I've done

Related work comes after, comparing what I've done to what others have

Possibly a discussion chapter after core, but before related work

Lit review comments:

Different levels of detail, e.g. 1.2 and 1.3 are higher level, 1.5 is quite
nitty gritty

Seems a bit disjointed: maybe add introductory paragraph for the section as a
whole, and a leading sentence or two for each to say why it's relevant. Plus
conclusiony bits as well.

reference for muller (in pascal and babbage sentence) is a bit dodgy

"mathematicians, such as"

"and evaluating ....." should mention proof in this list

Lit review should talk about ATP somewhere

"recent implementations" such as?

1.2 is missing some references

"despite claiming" seems a bit harsh

Mention HR in ATF (HR3 is out now, etc.); maybe also Coinvent, HDTP,
Dr Inventor, CrossBee, FloWr,

1.3

User interface, or should it be user interaction? (Probably)

Mention that theorema aims for pretty notation, etc.

Mention how theorema isn't *really* the same as the following tools

Mention evaluation of MTE

1.4

Should property

Page 6: "unbounded!" Remove exclamation mark?

Maybe get more of a software person to look at the Haskelly section (Edwin,
etc.?)

Maybe make a list too, for who could be external examiner. Edwin? Conor? Moa?
Koen? Stephen? Probably not Jianguo (conflict of interest?)

Overall, we want the lit review to highlight a gap or problem in the existing
work; hence building up to our research question.

If we have extension, we can finish off bucketing paper.

No budget from Dreamers, etc.

ICCC paper has been accepted

Alison will ask about viva being in extension or not
