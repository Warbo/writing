This comparison indicates that most stellar systems formed in the galaxy are likely single and not binary as has been often asserted. Indeed, in the current epoch two-thirds of all main sequence stellar systems in the Galactic disk are composed of single stars. Some implications of this realization for understanding the star and planet formation process are briefly mentioned.",

  abstract =	 {{Information is a central topic in computer science,
                  cognitive science, and philosophy. In spite of its
                  importance in the "information age," there is no
                  consensus on what information is, what makes it
                  possible, and what it means for one medium to carry
                  information about another. Drawing on ideas from
                  mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, this
                  book addresses the definition and place of
                  information in society. The authors, observing that
                  information flow is possible only within a connected
                  distribution system, provide a mathematically
                  rigorous, philosophically sound foundation for a
                  science of information. They illustrate their theory
                  by applying it to a wide range of phenomena, from
                  file transfer to DNA, from quantum mechanics to
                  speech act theory.}},
