Hi Chris,

I made some notes of people's suggestions during your transfer; as a memo
for your future studies

   - You need to include type analysis (Marco)

   - You need to include recursion analysis (Marco)

   - Perhaps analyse how specific your TE techniques to programming
   languages (TE in general does not rely on theorem proving, for example)
   (Alison)

   - Be mindful about approaches to testing (Stephen)

   - Check testing methods in ML4PG journal version (Katya)

   - Perhaps analysis and development of methodology concerning statistical
   evaluation of ML techniques for proving may be one of the objectives and
   contributions of your thesis (Katya)

   - cluster values to feature values -- needs more thought (Stephen)

   - use  kernel methods (Stephen)

   - Rel work: Marco "Learning refinement types" ICFP'15

   - work on learning in Microsoft research

   - Unifying theory exploration and theory formation (Alison)

   - Workplan: more emphasis on measuring, experiments, reproduciblility
   (Marco & Stephen)
